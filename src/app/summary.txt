To summarize:

ValueAccessor<T>:
Implements the Control Value Accessor pattern from Angular

ElementBase<T> extends ValueAccessor<T>:

Provides observable values to its parent about its validity state
Provides a validate method which can also be used in the control and which works off of validators injected through hierarchical dependency injection (eg. a required or minlength directive).
Actual @Component for input controls will extend ElementBase<T> where T is the type of data that control deals with (string for text box, boolean for checkbox, etc).
